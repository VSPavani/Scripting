# Lab 4 - Scripting and Automation  

The designs of various Verilog modules are synthesized, implemented, and reports have been generated. The reports include the **timing report, power report, and utilization report**.  

The extracted values from these reports are stored in **Final_results.csv**.  

## Report Formulation  

The report formulation includes the following steps:  

- The modules were stored in a folder.  
- The folder and other files (`add_tcl`, `create_tcl`, `run_tcl`) were cloned to VS Code.  
- The `Tcl_scripting.py` file was executed in the terminal, automatically generating the final results.
